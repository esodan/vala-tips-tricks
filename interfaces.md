# GInterface

You should [take a round](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gtype-non-instantiable-classed.html) to understand GInterface to use it efectivaly in Vala.

Vala uses `interface` clause to declare interfaces. They use prerequisites in order to provide basic functionalities and to ensure you will have necessary infrastructure implemented in your class to be useful. Take a look to [Interface definition prerequisites](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/howto-interface-prerequisite.html), in order to better understand C code generated by Vala.

## Default pre-requisites

All your interfaces should depend on `Object`. Then declaring an interface with that is an error and will produce invalid C code.

```cpp
public interface YourInterface : Object {}
```

## Order of pre-requisites
