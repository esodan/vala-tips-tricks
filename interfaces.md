# GInterface

You should [take a round](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gtype-non-instantiable-classed.html) to understand GInterface to use it efectivaly in Vala.

Vala uses `interface` clause to declare interfaces. They use prerequisites in order to provide basic functionalities and to ensure you will have necessary infrastructure implemented in your class to be useful. Take a look to [Interface definition prerequisites](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/howto-interface-prerequisite.html), in order to better understand C code generated by Vala.

## Default Prerequisites

All your interfaces should depend on `Object`. Then declaring an interface with that is an error and will produce invalid C code.

```cpp
public interface YourInterface : Object {}
```

## Order of Prerequisites

At this time you should understand that prerequisites adding matters. In Vala you should declare your interface and its prerequisites in left to right order, in order to avoid runtime errores due to missing implementations.

Remember: Even if you add prerequisites at the end, they are considered as not implemented.

```
public interface YourInterface : Object, Foo, Bar {}
```

In the example above, your should be sure that `Foo`, as a prerequisite of `Bar` is listed first, in order to declare correctly implementations and avoid errors.
